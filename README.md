### Source Code

I have found a bug in the new service pack. At least for me. With the new service pack start a new project and load a listview to reports, add some columns and try to reorder the columns. Complete VB crash. also old programs that can reodrer that worked before no longer work with the new files installed!! Please if you have this problem to post here. I wonder how we could have microsoft fix this, cause this is a big bug that will affect a lot of programs out there.
